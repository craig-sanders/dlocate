=head1 NAME

dpkg-unhold - mark held packages for installation

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<dpkg-unhold> [I<package>...]

=head1 WARNING

This command is B<deprecated>,
and will be removed during in Debian forky,
use C<dpkg --set-selections> or C<apt-mark> instead.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<dpkg-unhold> marks package(s) to be installed.

It achieves this by running C<dpkg --set-selections> and piping in the
package name(s) followed by B<install>.

NOTE: This program does not install, remove, purge any package. It ONLY
sets the status of the package. Any actual removal or purging is done
the next time B<dselect>, B<apt-get>, B<aptitude>, etc are run.

=head1 BUGS

The name is little bit of a misnomer in that it marks the package for
installation. This effectively "unholds" the package if it is held, but
will cause B<dselect>/B<apt>/etc to install it if it wasn't already installed.
