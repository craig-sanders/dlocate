dlocate for Debian
----------------------

fast alternative to 'dpkg -L', 'dpkg -S' etc.


NOTE: the 'dlocate -l' is NOT the same as 'dpkg -l' and i will ignore
bug reports which point out this obvious fact.

it is a simplistic emulation, not an exact clone.

IMO, it is more useful than 'dpkg -l'. if you disagree, then you are
free to use the slower original.
