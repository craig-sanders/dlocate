dlocate (1.02) unstable; urgency=low

  * fixed example in dlocate.1 man page again (Closes: #466662)
  * added '-k', and '-K' commands to list kernels and related packages
  * added optional support for gzip compression of /var/lib/dlocate/dlocatedb.txt
  * added support output filters (--package-only, --filename-only) (Closes: #531641)

 -- Craig Sanders <cas@taz.net.au>  Wed, 03 Jun 2009 11:24:02 +1000

dlocate (1.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * added support for diversions (Closes: #304045)
  * fixed copy/paste error for -P (now correctly passes -P to grep rather than -E)
  * really moved the four dpkg-* man pages to section 8

 -- Craig Sanders <cas@taz.net.au>  Mon, 01 Jun 2009 09:56:54 +1000

dlocate (1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * no longer use frcode and locate, see discussion in 494673.  removed
    dependency on locate package. (Closes: #505997, #494651, #494673)
  * added support for several GNU grep options, -E, -F, -G, -P, and -w
  * the extra grep options obsolete the request for shell glob patterns (Closes: #49922)
  * checked for empty $PKGS (Closes: #523501)
  * fixed '-man' option, so that it doesn't break on man directories with locales
  * tired of people filing the same bug because they misunderstand the purpose of '-man'.  added 'sort -u'.  (Closes: #501870)
  * updated and fixed dlocate.1 man page (Closes: #518309)
  * corrected 'dlocate -l' example in man page (Closes: #466662)
  * moved man pages for dpkg-hold, dpkg-unhold, dpkg-purge, dpkg-remove to section 8 (Closes: #512446)
  * added --verbose option to aid in debugging dlocate
  * fixed bug that broke support for multiple packages in most commands
  * fixed '-s' command so that it only calls grep-dctrl once if there are multiple package names
  * applied following 6 lintian fixes from era eriksson: (Closes: #513470)
  * debian/control: revert dependency on awk; as per Lintian error,
    it is in practice essential, and should not be declared
  * debian/copyright: add copyright year; disambiguate license as GPL v2
    (fix lintian warning)
  * debian/rules: move binary-arch commands to binary-indep; do not ignore
    errors from "make clean" (fix lintian warnings)
  * debian/changelog: fix typo in 0.96.1 s/dancy/dency/ (fix lintian warning)
  * debian/postinst: don't use explicit path for /usr/sbin (fix lintian warning)
  * debian/postrm: add -e flag (fix lintian warning)

 -- Craig Sanders <cas@taz.net.au>  Sat, 30 May 2009 16:53:51 +1000

dlocate (0.96.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added bash completion rules.  only one trivial change to the
    patch provided by Danilo Piazzalunga (Closes: #223718)

 -- Craig Sanders <cas@taz.net.au>  Fri, 27 Jun 2008 20:31:44 +1000

dlocate (0.96.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * version 0.95 introduced a dependency on awk, which is an optional
    package. the simple awk script has only been tested on my system
    with gawk, but it doesn't do anything gawkish so should work with
    mawk or original-awk. fixed Depends line.

 -- Craig Sanders <cas@taz.net.au>  Fri, 27 Jun 2008 19:58:57 +1000

dlocate (0.96) unstable; urgency=low

  * accidentally deleted cron.daily rather than updating it.  restored it.
    (Closes: 488222)
  * updated postinst to generate /var/lib/dlocate/dpkg.list with tab-
    separated fields, the same way that /etc/cron.daily/dlocate does.
    also removed COLUMNS=200 because the postinst doesn't need it any
    more than the cron.daily does.
  * updated man page for update-dlocatedb to note additional author

 -- Craig Sanders <cas@taz.net.au>  Fri, 27 Jun 2008 18:46:38 +1000

dlocate (0.95) unstable; urgency=low

  * changed cron.daily to not use ionice if kernel version <2.6.13
  * redirected stderr from ionice to >/dev/null to avoid error
    messages if running under vserver or other environments without
    CFQ scheduling (Closes: #456292)
  * added Pawel Chmielowski <prefiks@prefiks.org> patch to
    update-dlocatedb which re-uses any old data from the existing
    dlocatedb.  (Closes: #457572)
  * changed separator character when building the search regexp so
    that we don't end up grepping for everything.  (Closes: #466662)
  * while/read loops in bash are abysmally slow.  replaced that loop
    in 'dlocate -l' section with an awk script.  vast improvement in
    speed.  
    Note: this required changing the field separator in $DPKGLIST from
    space to tab, so anyone who parses that file directly (nobody, i
    think) may need to modify their scripts.
    (Closes: #487471)
  * finally close some bugs that were actually closed ages ago in 
    NMUs.  (Closes: #314276, #337711, #83196, #54073, #63902, #84018, #67650, #78621, #132930, #91785, #100694, #101426, #129251,  #132931, #129186, #76149, #43145, #43146, #45057, #42314)

 -- Craig Sanders <cas@taz.net.au>  Thu, 26 Jun 2008 20:53:30 +1000

dlocate (0.94) unstable; urgency=low

  * optimisation for '-S' and 'DEFAULT' commands.  run locate once
    only with multiple filenames on the command line.  significantly
    faster when searching for multiple filenames.
  * the optimisation also means that $result is the exit-code of
    all searches combined, rather than just the exit-code of the
    last search to be run.

 -- Craig Sanders <cas@taz.net.au>  Thu, 29 Nov 2007 18:30:01 +1100

dlocate (0.93) unstable; urgency=low

  * minor fix to -lsbin.  now excludes all non-files, rather than
    just directories.  also follows symlinks.
  * added '--' option to make it possible to search for partial
    files like -conf, -ls, and other '-*' that happen to match
    dlocate options.  did i already mention that dlocate's
    arg processing really sucks and needs a rewrite?
  * added Makefile rules ("make test") to automate testing of dlocate
    output, and to remind me to update the version banner in dlocate.
  * check for unknown options (Closes: #220351, #307371)
    (NOTE: breaks backwards-compatibility for anyone who relies on
    the old behaviour!)
  * only print header for 'dlocate -l' if there are any matching
    packages found. (Closes: #447140)
  * fixed dlocate's stderr redirection so that 'make test' works.
    (possible bug in bash - '>/dev/stderr' treated differently to '>&2')

 -- Craig Sanders <cas@taz.net.au>  Thu, 29 Nov 2007 18:27:22 +1100

dlocate (0.92) unstable; urgency=low

  * passed '--' to egrep so you can search for partial package names
    like '-utils', '-tools', etc.
  * fixed a bug in -md5check which prevented it from checking some
    packages with spaces in the filenames.
  * used '-r' ("--no-run-if-empty") everywhere with xargs.
    (Closes: #452746)
  * also changed numerous tests of [ -e $PKG.* ] to [ -s $PKG.* ]
    to test for 'exists and not empty' rather than just 'exists'.
  * removed output of double-quotes (0x22) surrounding $PKG to
    make stderr output more parser-friendly.
  * added simple script to test dlocate output prior to uploading
    a new version (script is in source package only)

 -- Craig Sanders <cas@taz.net.au>  Mon, 26 Nov 2007 19:26:50 +1100

dlocate (0.91) unstable; urgency=low

  * corrected minor mistake in dpkg-remove man page.

 -- Craig Sanders <cas@taz.net.au>  Thu, 22 Nov 2007 21:20:26 +1100

dlocate (0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * cron.daily doesn't need to have COLUMNS=200.  this was fixed in dpkg
    years ago.
  * redirect error output from -lsbin to /dev/null.  (Closes: #452297)
  * made -lsbin output consistent with other -ls options
  * added dpkg-hold, dpkg-unhold, dpkg-remove, and dpkg-purge to /usr/sbin.
    simple command line tools that i've been using for years to
    flag/unflag a package for hold, or flag it to be removed or purged.
    They *ONLY* change the status of the package which will be noticed
    the next time dpkg, dselect, or apt-get is run.
  * wrote simple man pages for dpkg-{hold,unhold,remove,purge}
  * really fixed bad handling of first arg this time (Closes: #380081)
  * updated date in dlocate.1 man page

 -- Craig Sanders <cas@taz.net.au>  Thu, 22 Nov 2007 20:48:19 +1100

dlocate (0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * call md5sum -c with '-' rather than /dev/stdin (Closes: #413804)
  * can not reproduce 61790, and nobody else has ever reported anything
    similar.  probably some problem with cron on Lazarus' system at the
    time (Apr 2000).  (Closes: #61790)
  * improved error messages from update-dlocatedb.  also modified
    script to comply with 'use strict;'.  (Closes: #361196)

 -- Craig Sanders <cas@taz.net.au>  Wed, 21 Nov 2007 10:29:20 +1100

dlocate (0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * fixed small bug in arg handling
  * added more commentary and examples in the dlocate man page to resolve
    various searching issues (both locate and egrep are different to dpkg's
    shell-style pattern matching).
    Also added 'SEE ALSO locate(1)' to the man page.
    (Closes: #441183, #208425, #447141)
  * man page for dpkg is in section 1.  (Closes: #354648)
  * added -lsman option to list full path/filename of man pages.
    (Closes: #361125, #289351)
  * added -lsbin option to list full path/filename of binaries
    (Closes: #441109)

 -- Craig Sanders <cas@taz.net.au>  Wed, 21 Nov 2007 01:53:17 +1100

dlocate (0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied patch from Andreas Metzler: GNU locate has been split off to
    a separate package. Adapt dlocate to work both with the new and the
    old setup.  (Closes: #451750)
  * always pass '--' to locate.  (Closes: #360824, #360824)
  * can not reproduce bug 65974.  my guess is that update-dlocatedb hadn't
    been run.  (Closes: #65974)
  * error messages now go to stderr (Closes: 375271)
  * first option is no longer a special case (Closes: #380081)
  * 'LINES=40' isn't needed.  removed.  (Closes: #224947)
  * shameful trailing blanks removed from -l output (Closes: #261733)
  * 'dlocate -l' no longer outputs one header for each package name.
    (Closes: #268288, #319251, #354285)
  * added '/' to start of dlocate -man regexp.  (Closes: #290562)
  * dlocate now has --version and -V options (Closes: #223698)
  * dlocate really needs a rewrite.  it started as a Q&D hack and grew
    beyond that.  the remaining bugs need a rewrite to fix.
    expect a rewrite from scratch soon.

 -- Craig Sanders <cas@taz.net.au>  Tue, 20 Nov 2007 23:12:18 +1100

dlocate (0.5-0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-Maintainer Upload.
  * Updated Standards version to 3.7.2.1
  * Depend on dctrl-tools or grep-dctrl (Closes: #314276)
  * Remove -v from md5check routine so md5checking works with md5sum from
    textutils (Closes: #318980)
  * Change Build-Depends-Indep to Build-Depends since debhelper is called from
    the clean target, this makes dlocate lintian clean.
  * Apply patch from Sam Morris to return non-zero if a package is not
    installed (Closes: #123777, #322290, #213292, 364318)
  * Make database backups atomic (Closes: #372151)
  * Apply patch from Nicolas Fancios to fix typos in manpage (Closes: #271328)

 -- Bastian Kleineidam <calvin@debian.org>  Fri, 25 Nov 2005 16:58:10 +0100

dlocate (0.5-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-Maintainer Upload.
  * NMU, Craig Sanders seems to have lost his interest in this package,
    last upload was in 1999.
  * Upload sponsored by Thom May <thom@debian.org>.

    patch from Peter Samuelson (Closes: #91785)
  * Works with slocate, using dpkg-divert --truename, patch from Robert
    Luberda, depend on dpkg 1.8.0, drop superfluous versioned conflicts
    on very old dpkg. Once this is uploaded I'll ask the slocate-maintainer
    to remove the "Conflicts: dlocate".
    (Closes: #100694, #101426, #129251)
  * depend on perl. (Closes: #132931)
  * Use nice quotation marks in dlocate(1) (Closes: #129186)

    findutils and bash are essential, depending on them is wrong
    copyright: fix location of GPL
    update-dlocatedb has no manpage.
    Add versioned Build-Depends-Indep: debhelper >= 3.0.0 (dh_installmanpages)
    Bump standards-version.

 -- Andreas Metzler <ametzler@downhill.at.eu.org>  Sun, 10 Mar 2002 09:44:16 +0100

dlocate (0.5) unstable; urgency=low
  * make /etc/cron.daily/dlocate a conffile.  (closes: 49458)
  * changed Depends: dpkg >= 1.4.1.10 to Conflicts: dpkg 1.4.1.[789] according
    to wichert's suggestion in bug 46614
  * add closes line to changelog for all the bugs that were closed
    in previous versions but i didn't get the closes syntax right:
    (closes: #43194 #45239 #46614 #45057, #43145, #43146  #42234 #42314 #42210 #42248)

 -- Craig Sanders <cas@taz.net.au>  Tue,  2 Nov 1999 19:01:27 +1100

dlocate (0.4) unstable; urgency=low
  * changed 'dpkg -l' to 'dpkg -l "*"' so that the list includes purged
    packages as well.

 -- Craig Sanders <cas@taz.net.au>  Tue,  2 Nov 1999 19:01:27 +1100

dlocate (0.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * replaced cron.d script /etc/cron.daily/dlocate (fixes #43194 #45239)
  * added dependency on dpkg >= 1.4.10, (fixes #46614)
  * added simplistic emulation of 'dpkg -l' (fixes #45057, #43145, #43146)
    NOTE: this is NOT the same as 'dpkg -l' and i will ignore bug reports
    which point out this obvious fact.  it is a simplistic emulation, not
    an exact clone.  IMO, it is more useful than 'dpkg -l'.  if you
    disagree, then you are free to use the slower original.

 -- Craig Sanders <cas@taz.net.au>  Tue,  2 Nov 1999 17:05:56 +1100

dlocate (0.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * use a version of the fast perl script submitted by hallon@debian.org
    rather than make, sed, and perl. it even finishes the job faster than
    make can decide whether to update the dlocatedb file or not. (fixes #42234)
  * this makes it viable to build initial db in background (fixes #42314)
  * doesn't depend on make anymore.
  * depends on grep-dctrl >= 0.11 (fixes #42210)
  * updated dlocate man page (fixes #42248)

 -- Craig Sanders <cas@taz.net.au>  Tue,  3 Aug 1999 08:34:12 +1000

  * added postinst to create /var/lib/dlocate/dlocatedb at install time (fixes #42120)

 -- Craig Sanders <cas@taz.net.au>  Fri, 30 Jul 1999 11:09:27 +1000

dlocate (0.1-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * bashisms in scripts, #!/bin/sh is bad - change to #!/bin/bash
  * fixed bashism in cron.d script, use >/dev/null not >&
  * wrote a man page for dlocate(1)

 -- Craig Sanders <cas@taz.net.au>  Thu, 22 Jul 1999 08:46:56 +1000

dlocate (0.1-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * add copyright (GPL)

 -- Craig Sanders <cas@taz.net.au>  Tue, 20 Jul 1999 11:15:48 +1000

dlocate (0.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * depends on grep-dctrl, not dpkg-awk
  * also depends on make
  * made it use /usr/bin/locate.old if it exists - solves incompatibility
    with slocate.

 -- Craig Sanders <cas@taz.net.au>  Tue, 20 Jul 1999 10:58:21 +1000

dlocate (0.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

dlocate (0.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * i'll get it right eventually - should be arch: all, not i386
  * touching the initial dlocatedb makes it fail an md5sum check,
    so modify /usr/lib/dlocate/Makefile instead

 -- Craig Sanders <cas@taz.net.au>  Fri, 16 Jul 1999 12:23:28 +1000

dlocate (0.1-2) unstable; urgency=low
