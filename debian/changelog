dlocate (0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * cron.daily doesn't need to have COLUMNS=200.  this was fixed in dpkg
    years ago.
  * redirect error output from -lsbin to /dev/null.  (Closes: #452297)
  * made -lsbin output consistent with other -ls options
  * added dpkg-hold, dpkg-unhold, dpkg-remove, and dpkg-purge to /usr/sbin.
    simple command line tools that i've been using for years to
    flag/unflag a package for hold, or flag it to be removed or purged.
    They *ONLY* change the status of the package which will be noticed
    the next time dpkg, dselect, or apt-get is run.
  * write simple man pages for dpkg-{hold,unhold,remove,purge}
  * really fixed bad handling of first arg this time (Closes: #380081)
  * updated date in dlocate.1 man page

dlocate (0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * call md5sum -c with '-' rather than /dev/stdin (Closes: #413804)
  * can not reproduce 61790, and nobody else has ever reported anything
    similar.  probably some problem with cron on Lazarus' system at the
    time (Apr 2000).  (Closes: #61790)
  * improved error messages from update-dlocatedb.  also modified
    script to comply with 'use strict;'.  (Closes: #361196)

 -- Craig Sanders <cas@taz.net.au>  Wed, 21 Nov 2007 10:29:20 +1100

dlocate (0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * fixed small bug in arg handling
  * added more commentary and examples in the dlocate man page to resolve
    various searching issues (both locate and egrep are different to dpkg's
    shell-style pattern matching).  
    Also added 'SEE ALSO locate(1)' to the man page.
    (Closes: #441183, #208425, #447141)
  * man page for dpkg is in section 1.  (Closes: #354648)
  * added -lsman option to list full path/filename of man pages.
    (Closes: #361125, #289351)
  * added -lsbin option to list full path/filename of binaries
    (Closes: #441109)

 -- Craig Sanders <cas@taz.net.au>  Wed, 21 Nov 2007 01:53:17 +1100

dlocate (0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied patch from Andreas Metzler: GNU locate has been split off to
    a separate package. Adapt dlocate to work both with the new and the
    old setup.  (Closes: #451750)
  * always pass '--' to locate.  (Closes: #360824, #360824)
  * can not reproduce bug 65974.  my guess is that update-dlocatedb hadn't
    been run.  (Closes: #65974)
  * error messages now go to stderr (Closes: 375271)
  * first option is no longer a special case (Closes: #380081)
  * 'LINES=40' isn't needed.  removed.  (Closes: #224947)
  * shameful trailing blanks removed from -l output (Closes: #261733)
  * 'dlocate -l' no longer outputs one header for each package name.  
    (Closes: #268288, #319251, #354285)
  * added '/' to start of dlocate -man regexp.  (Closes: #290562)
  * dlocate now has --version and -V options (Closes: #223698)
  * dlocate really needs a rewrite.  it started as a Q&D hack and grew
    beyond that.  the remaining bugs need a rewrite to fix.
    expect a rewrite from scratch soon.

  * Non-Maintainer Upload.
  * Updated Standards version to 3.7.2.1
  * Depend on dctrl-tools or grep-dctrl (Closes: #314276)
  * Remove -v from md5check routine so md5checking works with md5sum from
    textutils (Closes: #318980)
  * Change Build-Depends-Indep to Build-Depends since debhelper is called from
    the clean target, this makes dlocate lintian clean.

    installed (Closes: #123777, #322290, #213292, 364318)

dlocate (0.5) unstable; urgency=low
  * make /etc/cron.daily/dlocate a conffile.  (closes: 49458)
  * changed Depends: dpkg >= 1.4.1.10 to Conflicts: dpkg 1.4.1.[789] according
    to wichert's suggestion in bug 46614
  * add closes line to changelog for all the bugs that were closed
    in previous versions but i didn't get the closes syntax right:
    (closes: #43194 #45239 #46614 #45057, #43145, #43146  #42234 #42314 #42210 #42248)

dlocate (0.4) unstable; urgency=low
  * changed 'dpkg -l' to 'dpkg -l "*"' so that the list includes purged
    packages as well.

 -- Craig Sanders <cas@taz.net.au>  Tue,  2 Nov 1999 19:01:27 +1100

dlocate (0.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * replaced cron.d script /etc/cron.daily/dlocate (fixes #43194 #45239)
  * added dependency on dpkg >= 1.4.10, (fixes #46614)
  * added simplistic emulation of 'dpkg -l' (fixes #45057, #43145, #43146)
    NOTE: this is NOT the same as 'dpkg -l' and i will ignore bug reports
    which point out this obvious fact.  it is a simplistic emulation, not
    an exact clone.  IMO, it is more useful than 'dpkg -l'.  if you 
    disagree, then you are free to use the slower original.

 -- Craig Sanders <cas@taz.net.au>  Tue,  2 Nov 1999 17:05:56 +1100

dlocate (0.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * use a version of the fast perl script submitted by hallon@debian.org
    rather than make, sed, and perl. it even finishes the job faster than
    make can decide whether to update the dlocatedb file or not. (fixes #42234)
  * this makes it viable to build initial db in background (fixes #42314)
  * doesn't depend on make anymore.
  * depends on grep-dctrl >= 0.11 (fixes #42210)
  * updated dlocate man page (fixes #42248)
