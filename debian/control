Description: fast alternative to dpkg -L and dpkg -S 
 Uses GNU locate to greatly speed up finding out which package a file
 belongs to (i.e. a very fast dpkg -S). Many other uses, including
 options to view all files in a package, calculate disk space used, view
 and check md5sums, list man pages, etc.
