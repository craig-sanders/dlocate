Description: fast alternative to dpkg -L and dpkg -S
 Uses GNU grep and text dumps of dpkg's data to greatly speed up finding
 out which package a file belongs to (i.e. a very fast dpkg -S). Many
 other uses, including options to view all files in a package, calculate
 disk space used, view and check md5sums, list man pages, etc.
