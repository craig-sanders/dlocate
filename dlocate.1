.SH NAME
dlocate - program to view debian package information

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dlocate
.RI [ OPTIONS ]
.RI [ command ]
.RB [ 
.IR package .\|.\|.
|
.IR PATTERN .\|.\|.]
.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
.B dlocate
is a fast alternative to dpkg for queries like `dpkg -L' and `dpkg -S'

.SH COMMANDS
.TP
.BR (none)
List all records where either the package name or the filename matches
.IR PATTERN .

Note that dlocate uses GNU grep, so normal regexp metacharacters need to be taken into account or avoided
by using the '-F' (Fixed String) grep option.

For example, to search for `/usr/bin/[', you might try:
\fBdlocate '/usr/bin/\\['\fP
or
\fBdlocate -F '/usr/bin/['\fP
.TP
.BR \-S
list all records where only the filename matches
.IR PATTERN .

Note that dlocate uses GNU grep, so normal regexp metacharacters need to be taken into account.
Fixed String searches are incompatible with -S

For example, to search for `/usr/bin/[', you need to type:

\fBdlocate  '/usr/bin/\\['\fP

.TP
.BR \-l
Regexp-enhanced emulation of `dpkg \-l'.  Shows all packages which match
.IR package .

Internally this uses grep on a file containing the reformatted
output output of 'dpkg \-l' (four fields separated by tabs; status,
package-name, installed version, short description) so it will return
packages whose version or short description matches, too.

Regular expression are supported. For example,

\fB./dlocate \-l '^..[[:space:]]libc6'\fP

will list all the packages whose names start with `libc6'.

Note that because of the difference between regular expressions and
dpkg's shell\-style pattern matching, the output from \fBdlocate -l\fP
is occasionally different to the output from \fBdpkg -l\fP.

This is not a bug, regular expressions are far more flexible than shell
pattern matching.  This is the way dlocate is supposed to run, but it
may require some knowledge of regular expressions to get the output you
want.

.TP
.BR \-L
List all files in 
.IR package .
.TP
.BR \-s
Print status of
.IR package .
.TP
.BR \-ls
`ls \-ldF' of all files in
.IR package .
.TP
.BR \-lsconf
`ls \-ldF' of conffiles in
.IR package .
.TP
.BR \-conf
List conffiles in
.IR package .
.TP
.BR \-du
`du \-sck' of all files in
.IR package .
.TP
.BR \-md5sum
List md5sums (if any) of 
.IR package .
.TP
.BR \-md5check
Check md5sums (if any) of 
.IR package .
.TP
.BR \-man
List man pages (if any) in
.IR package .
.TP
.BR \-lsman
List full path/filenames of man pages (if any) in
.IR package .
.TP
.BR \-lsbin
List full path/filenames of executable files (if any) in
.IR package .

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-w ", " \-\^\-word\-regexp
Select only those lines containing matches that form whole words.
The test is that the matching substring must either be at the
beginning of the line, or preceded by a non-word constituent
character.
Similarly, it must be either at the end of the line
or followed by a non-word constituent character.
Word-constituent characters are letters, digits, and the underscore.
.TP
.BR \-i ", " --ignore-case
Ignore case distinctions in the PATTERN 
.TP
.BR \-E ", " \-\^\-extended\-regexp
Interpret
.I PATTERN
as an extended regular expression.
This is the default.
.TP
.BR \-F ", " \-\^\-fixed\-strings
Interpret
.I PATTERN
as a list of fixed strings, separated by newlines,
any of which is to be matched.
.TP
.BR \-G ", " \-\^\-basic\-regexp
Interpret
.I PATTERN
as a basic regular expression.
.TP
.BR \-P ", " \-\^\-perl\-regexp
Interpret
.I PATTERN
as a Perl regular expression.
This is considered to be highly experimental within GNU grep and may warn of unimplemented features.
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-H ", " \-\-help
Produces a short help message and exits.
.TP
.BR \-V ", " \-\-version
Display dlocate's version number and exit.
.TP
.BR \-v ", " \-\-verbose ", " \-\-debug
Produce verbose debugging output
.PP

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.TP
.BR COLUMNS
Sets the number of columns \fBdlocate\fP should use when displaying formatted
text.  Currently only used by \-l. Values lower than 80 are ignored.
