.SH NAME
dpkg-unhold - program to flag for installation a package or packages


.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dpkg-unhold
.RI [ PACKAGE .\|.\|.]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
.B dpkg-unhold
marks package(s) to be held.

it achieves this by running `dpkg --set-selections' and piping in the
package name(s) followed by `install'.

NOTE: this program does not install, remove, purge any package. it ONLY
sets the status of the package. any actual removal or purging is done
the next time dselect, apt-get, aptitude, etc are run.

.SH "BUGS"

The name is little bit of a misnomer in that it marks the package for
installation. this effectively "unholds" the package if it is held, but
will cause dselect/apt/etc to install it if it wasn't already installed.
